# About the protocol

A user deployed a sample contract with 10 wETH in balance, looking like it can execute flash loans of wETH.
All funds are at risk! Rescue all wETH from the user and the pool and deposit it into the designated recovery account.

Empty out the wETH user
    The only way to empty out this person is getting him on the fee because it is a fixed amount. 
    In the onFlashLoan, it has not defined which address, just an address. This means no context and the flashLoan can be requested on his behalf 
    
    On normal implementation, call address initiator recognised by the Lender which is usually the contract calling the borrower

Recover the amount from the pool
    We need to impersonate a the correct msgSender in order to empty out the account. 
    This is made possible with the fact that there's an intermediary. `BasicForwarder`

## Logic
There is a fixed fee of 1wETH on each loan

- onFlashLoan()
    Access control problem, it ignores the first address which is essentially the initiator of the flash loan. 
    This means anyone can request flash loans on his behalf, the receiver has to pay the fee and loan back.

    `_msgSender()` We can craft a transaction that comes from the trusted forwarder and since we control the msg.data. 
    we can make sure the last 20 bytes are any address of any account that we wish to control
    Allowing us to impersonate and call withdraw()
